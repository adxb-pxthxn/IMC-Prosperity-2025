    "# Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "With a large school of turtle visiting, an opportunity arises to acquire some top grade `Flippers`. You only have two chances to offer a good price. Each one of the turtle will accept the lowest bid that is over their reserve price. You know there’s a constant desire for flippers on the archipelago. So, at the end of the round, you’ll be able to sell them for 320 SeaShells a piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "!-- Whilst not every turtle has the same reserve price, you know the distribution of their reserve prices. The reserve price will be no lower than 900 and no higher than 1000. The probability scales linearly from 0 at 900 to most likely at 1000. --!\n",
    "\n",
    "You only trade with the turtle. For the second bid, they are more likely to trade with you if your second bid is higher than the average second bid\n",

    "# Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $n$ denote the number of turtle and assume each turtle has a single unit of flippers to sell.  \n",
    "For each $i\\in \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$, turtle $i$ has a reserve price $R_i$: turtle $i$ will sell its flippers iff the bid $p$ verifies $p\\geq R_i$.\n",
