# Competition Details
IMC Prosperity 3 was a 15 day algorithmic trading challenge with over 10,000 worldwide participants. The challenge involved algorithmically trading various products, such as Rainforest Resin, Kelp, Squid Ink, Macarons, and more, with the goal of maximizing seashells: the underlying currency of the comp. 

Additionally each round featured a "manual" trading round which was a maths optimisation problem. These had a minor effect on total PNL each round, but were still relevant and often were the deciding factor on placement as leaderboards were close.
